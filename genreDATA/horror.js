Landis weaves the tale of a bigot who gets a walloping dose of his own hatred. Spielberg takes over with a fable of senior citizens offered a magical rejuvenation. Dante serves up a terror trip with a child who uses his cartoon-inspired powers to enslave his family.

There is talk of homeless people who use the tunnel as shelter going missing, even though the government states that there are no homeless people in there.
